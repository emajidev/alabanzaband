This is a mobile application which has the function of generating unique records for users "Directors" and "performers", these will have the option once the session  logged to access the musical repertoire and the director can schedule rehearsals sharing these songs. Each event will have a chat room where users can communicate and share information. There is also a filtering system for search songs. The moment the user enters, he has to wait for the director to create a new church, the system will generate a unique code and once this is done it will appear in a list of active to churches to the performer where the data of the church given by the directors will be shown.
